This model provides a daily summary of  orders aggregated by store, staff member, and manager.  
It is built on top of the `int_local_bike__one_big_table` model and includes key performance metrics:

- **Total revenue** generated by each staff member per day
- **Total number of orders**
- **Average basket** (revenue per order)


This table is ideal for monitoring staff performance, sales trends, and store-level activity.
